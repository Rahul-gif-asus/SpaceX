## 🧑‍💻 API Integration

We use the SpaceX API to fetch launch data. Here are the key API routes used in the project:

- `GET /launches` – Fetches all launches.
- `GET /launches/:id` – Fetches details of a specific launch.

## 🛠 Authentication

- Token-based authentication has been implemented for securing private routes.
- User session data is stored securely in MongoDB.

## 🎯 Bonus Features

- **Gallery Images**: View images related to rockets on the SpaceX detail page.
- **Fairing and Core Details**: View fairing and core information for each launch.
- **Back Navigation**: Easily navigate back to the resource list using the back button on the detail page.

## 🧪 Testing (Planned)

We plan to integrate testing using:
- Jest for unit testing.
- Cypress for end-to-end testing.
